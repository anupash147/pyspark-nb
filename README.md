# PySpark Notebook

This extends the jupyter/pyspark-notebook Docker container and adds some
additional Python packages, image processing support (in the form of
system libraries and headers as well as Python packages), and example
notebooks.

Notebooks included:

* simple-spark - reads a dataset from the web, trains a decision tree model, and evaluates the results.
